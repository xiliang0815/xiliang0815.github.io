# Objectives:
The topic of excessive force and police brutality has been rampant recently in America, among all subtopics, police killing is among the most sensitive and most covered. The main purpose of this project is answer some of the questions I have in mind:
* Is the police killing count increasing or decreasing?
* How police killing correlate demographic information like income, high school completion rate, race distribution, etc?
* Are there certain races that are more proned to police killing?

# Conclusion:
After going through our datasets thoroughly, here are some key findings we found:

1. The total police killing rate has been slowly declining since 2015, having California and Texas being the biggest contributors. However, a follow-up study is needed if one wants to find out what are the reasons that drove down the police killing rate in these two states.
2. Demographic information provides us a better understanding how they affect police killings. We see that neigbhourhoods that have higher porportion of black people tend to have higher police killings, while communities with majority white people tend to have less police killings. We also find that median income ha strong positive correlation with high school completion rate, and black communities' teens seem to have difficulties graduating from high school, hence there are a big portion of black communities living under poverty line.d
3. It's certain that there is racial disparties in how police offciers exercise their deadly force, as we see that the black and hispanic people being killed by police is disproportionate compare to the race distribution in the United States. We also find that victims who were unarmed and killed by police are more likely to be minorities.
